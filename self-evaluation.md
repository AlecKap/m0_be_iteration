# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - Very confident.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I didnt strugle with this aspect nearly as much as i thought i would but that can always change so i will continue to remain foucused on practicing the .ech method. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
        - so far my calnder had been very helpful. i continue to update it as my day goes on which has been really helpful when i go back to review at the end of the day.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
        - i do not have any questions at the moment.
